# Example codes of unimodal emotion recognition

For LSTM experiments on a single database we perform 10-fold cross validation (5-fold for BLSTM with parameter grid search)

For cross corpora experiments we perform training on one database and testing on another one, as well as training on merged databases

For multimodal emotion recognition using different modality fusion strategies see our other repo:
